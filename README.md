### Automatically

This has the following requirements!

At the loadout screen, after selecting your four stratagems, press LT + RT + Y.

### Manually

Click on the loadout stratagem you wish to change, then select from the list that pops up.

# Using Stratagems

Hold LB then press A, B, X, or Y to trigger a loadout stratagem.

For mission stratagems, hold LB + RB then press
- A for Hellbomb
- B for Eagle Rearm
- X for Resupply
- Y for Reinforcements

# Cooldown

For loadout stratagems, a cooldown is shown when they're triggered.

This cooldown may or may not be accurate!

It is calculated from that you've upgraded you ship fully and throw a stratagem as far as possible.

# Special Weapons

If you have the Epoch equipped, hold LT then press A once. The app will hold the fire button automatically for 2.5 seconds, which will generate the highest damage.
